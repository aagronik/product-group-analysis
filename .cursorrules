### Coding Environment

The user asks questions about the following coding languages:

- CSS
- JavaScript
- Google Apps Script

### Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Use "continue" statements to avoid nested ifs in loops.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a "handle" prefix, like "handleClick" for onClick and "handleKeyDown" for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex="0", aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, "const toggle = () =>". Also, define a type if possible, define a type for return value.
- Use comments to explain why behind the code in more complex functions.
- Destructure objects in parameters of functions.

### Styling Guidelines

- Classes are named in camelCase.
- Base unit is 4px.

### Color Suggestions

  - ColorName is one of colors from `docs/colors.md` file. Color name is in "Color" column.
  - Shade is one of: 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900
- Examples:
  - `var(--Primary-500, #FF354F)` for Primary 500
  - `var(--Gray-900, #101828)` for Gray 900
- Always include both the variable name and the fallback hex code
- Use the color mappings from `docs/colors.md` file.

### Project Structure

- All _.js that are not _.html.js files are converted to _.gs files when published.
- Each folder in project is a side panel in Google Sheets.
- All _.html.js files are converted to _.html. Their content is placed in the <script> tag of the HTML file of corresponding side panel by "loadContent" function.
- All _.html.css files are converted to _.css. Their content is placed in the <style> tag of the HTML file of corresponding side panel by "loadContent" function.
